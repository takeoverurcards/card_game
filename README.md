# Card Game Idea WIP
## Rules:

__________________________________________________________

game starts with five cards in both players' hands
decks consist of 50 cards each, plus one necromancy card
each player draws a card at the beginning of their turn
cards have colors and tribes that benefit from synergies
red = offense, blue = defense, yellow = support
mineral, plant, machine, animal, warrior, magic, merchant
three main slots in front, five aux slots in back
mains have health and power; auxes do not
mains can call attacks; auxes cannot call attacks
mains can be attacked; auxes cannot be attacked
all units can, however, be affected by effects
all units can also use their effects
mains must use main effect; auxes must use aux effect
first to attack the enemy directly three times wins
cannot attack directly if enemy controls a main
if a player is attacked directly, the attacker's turn ends
if attacked directly, draw two extra cards
at the start of the game, both players pick a necromancy card
necromancy cards are permanent and cannot be swapped or removed
item cards can be attached to mains, cannot be played as units
